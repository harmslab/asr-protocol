    "Keeping track of all of the files is always annoying in these projects.  I'm not sure there is a \"right\" way to do it, but here are a few principles that have kept me sane over the years:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Write up a `README` file and save it in the directory where you do your work.  This should say what you do at each step, the date you did it, and what files were involved.  This is the lab notebook for the project.  I prefer to keep this as a standalone file rather than a jupyter notebook because a text file will *always* be readable; who knows how jupyter will change in the future.\n",
    "+ Whenever you have to save out a file, do it with a numbered prefix and description.  Something like `00_initial-sequence-to-blast.fasta`, `01_blast-results.xml`, etc. This way, if you sort the directory, you can see what you did, in what order. \n",
    "+ Keep your sequences in a `.csv` file with columns for species, database id, raw sequence, aligned sequence, etc. You can then share this `.csv` file as the supplement to your paper.  *This protocol implements this `.csv` strategy throughout.*\n",
    "+ One of the standard phylogenetics file formats (`.phy`) requires sequences have 10 character names. This is *very annoying.* To deal with this problem, the pipeline assigns every sequence you add a unique 10-character ID of the format `XXXXXXXXXX` where `n` indicates an integer. At various points in the pipeline, you can interconvert between these internal sequence names and various human-readable names. \n",

    "## 1. Create a set of BLAST .xml files containing sequences\n",
    "\n",
    "Building sequence datasets is complicated.  How you go about it depends on what your goals are for the project.  In this protocol, I am going to assume we are looking members of protein families (meaning a mixture of orthologs and paralogs) from animals (meaning minimal lateral gene transfer). \n",
    "\n",
    "I'll mention two questions that often come up.  The first is: *should I include paralogs and orthologs?* For a gene tree—what we normally generate—you generally want to a large number of orthologs and paralogs. A good check for the quality of the tree is whether the orthologs group together and roughly reproduce the species tree.  In practice, this means BLASTing away and then grabbing as many sequences as possible without worrying too much about whether you are pulling down orthologs or paralogs.  \n",
    "\n",
    "One reason this is useful is that sequence databases sometimes have paralogs and orthologs mislabeled.  Imagine you are building a tree of protein *X*.  You BLAST the NCBI and pull out out a sequence labeled protein *Y*.  You then build a tree, including this protein, and find it groups squarely with the *X* proteins, but not the other *Y* proteins in your dataset.  The simplest explanation for this result is that the protein was annotated incorrectly.   If you had dropped this sequence from your analysis, just because it was labeled *Y*, you would have removed valuable information from your dataset.  \n",
    "\n",
    "A second question: *should I include \"hypothetical,\" predicted\", and \"low-quality\" sequences?* As is usual for bioinformatics, the answer is \"it depends.\" If the protein has a huge number of isoforms and weirdo splice sites, the predicted genes could be difficult to align and thus mess up your phylogeny. On the other hand, if the protein has a very well defined set of exons, you'd probably be okay. Further, you sometimes really need sequences from taxa for which sequencing data are particularly poor and a \"low-quality\" sequence is the best you can do.  In the following pipeline, we include everything up front, and then remove redundant sequences.  We preferentially remove these low-quality sequences if better sequences are available. This is implemented in the jupyter notebooks included in this protocol. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Practical thoughts:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ The bigger the initial dataset, the better. We can pare down later. \n",
    "\n",
    "+ Do not worry about duplicate sequences at this point; we'll remove them later. \n",
    "\n",
    "+ BLAST with multiple paralogs for the gene of interest, sampled from multiple species. \n",
    "\n",
    "+ Use PSI-BLAST to iteratively build your dataset.  In PSI-BLAST, your results from the first BLAST search are fed into the next BLAST search, yielding more hits overall.  This process can be repeated until you find no more new hits. \n",
    "\n",
    "+ Check for good taxonomic sampling. (You gain more information from 1,000 sequences from across mammals than just taking 1,000 sequences from rodents.) The `Taxonomy` tab on the blast interface is useful for this. If you are not seeing sequences from key species, you can do targeted BLAST within a clade.  \n",
    "\n",
    "  + To do this, use the `Organism` selection flag to make sure you get sequences from key lineages.  Since we often study vertebrate proteins, here's a useful strategy: do separate BLAST searches for: `Mammalia (taxid:40674)`, `Sauropsida (taxid:8457)`, `Amphibia (taxid:8292)`,  `bony fishes  (taxid:7898)`,  `Elasmobranchii (taxid:7778)` (skates, rays and sharks), `jawless vertebrates (taxid:1476529)` (hagfish and lampreys), and `tunicates (taxid:7712)` (closest non-vertebrate outgroup). I also usually do `lobe-finned fishes (taxid:118072)`, excluding `Tetrapoda (taxid:32523)`.  This should pull up lungfish and coelacanth sequences if available. \n",
    "  + If you get a ton of hits in your earliest-diverging lineage--`tunicates` above--it suggests the protein evolved earlier than you have sampled.  If so, expand to earlier-diverging groups.  In this case, you would expand to earlier-diverging groups like `Ecdysozoa (taxid:1206794)` (which includes both *D. Melanogaster* and *C. elegans*), `Lophotrochozoa (taxid:1206795)` and `Hemichordata (taxid:10219)`. \n",
    "  + If one of those searches yields a small number of hits, it might be worthwhile to search for non-NCBI genomes and transcriptomes in an effort to fill out the taxa. Some lineages are just have few sequence resources.  Amphibians are notoriously undersampled, and there are very few extant jawless vertebrates. As a result, these bits of vertebrate protein/gene treees are often sparse. \n",
    "  \n",
    "### Other sources of sequences\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note: If you have to go this route, you'll have to manually load the non-NCBI results into an existing topiary dataframe in excel or the like. See #12 XX below for an example. After manually adding information to the .csv file, you have to re-load it into a pandas dataframe and then write it back out into a new .csv file. Maybe this puts everything into the right dtype (?)\n",
    "*\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Some good places to look for sequences outside of NCBI are [Fish10K](https://db.cngb.org/datamart/animal/DATAani16/) and [Bird10K](https://b10k.genomics.cn/index.html). You can also switch to [tblastn](https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi?PROGRAM=tblastn&PAGE_TYPE=BlastSearch&LINK_LOC=blasthome) approach to see if there are nucleic acid sequences corresponding to your protein that have not been annotated as proteins.  I find [https://ensembl.org/](https://ensembl.org/) is the easiest database for this task. Finally, if you are desperate, can look for transcriptomes in the [short read archive](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra).  These often have to be assembled (a somewhat tedious process). \n",
    "\n",
    "+ [PFAM](http://pfam.xfam.org/) has some amazing pre-built alignments.  I've generally found them more useful for studies of whole domains evolving over very long timescales than our typical vertebrate protein work, but it's worth keeping in mind these alignments are out there. "

If a long branch occurs between clades, you can try to find new sequences that \"break\" the branch.

Open `10_ancestors_all.newick` in FigTree or your tree viewer of preference. Show the branch support values - branch support values indicate the degree to which one can be confident that the branch represents some \"signal\" present in the data. In other words, these values indicate how many times out of 100 (100/100 = 1) the same branch was observed when repeating the phylogenetic reconstruction on a re-sampled set of the data during the bootstrap analysis. Each reconstructed ancestral sequence is associated with a branch support value. We use these values to evaluate how confident we are in the reconstructed sequence. \n",

The black dots show the posterior probability that the amino acid called in the ancestor is the correct amino acid. The red dots show the posterior probability of the next most probable amino acid that could have been called at that the same position. The dashed line represents the posterior probability value if the site showed equal preference for any amino acid (ambiguous site), suggesting that red dots above this value represent amino acid substitutions that occurred frequently while red dots below this line suggest that the site's preference is skewed towards a specific amino acid. The histogram to the right displays the distribution of where these black and red points lie in the range of posterior probability. We have high confidence in our reconstructed ancestral node if the black and red histograms have little to no overlap."
