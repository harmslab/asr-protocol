### Running raxml

Check out the run_raxml.srun SLURM script for ways to run RAxML. To run this
analysis, you only need to upload an alignment.phy file generated by topiary.

### Running generax

To reconcile your species and gene tree, you need to first find the best
phylogenetic model and construct your ml tree using raxml. Then upload your
topiary .csv file and do the following:

1. Create a directory to run generax. Note the --bs-dir argument is optional and
   controls whether or not you run on bootstrap replicates.

   setup-generax -c topiary-df.csv -m `cat find-model/best-model.txt` -t ml-tree/02_ml-tree.newick -o generax-run --bs-dir ml-tree/01_make-ml-tree

2. After creating the generax-run directory, cd into it. You should see a script
   called 00_launch_generax_bootstrap.sh. This will launch generax on blocks of
   bootstrap replicates as individual slurm jobs. It takes a single argument
   which controls how many bootstrap reps are launched per job. The smaller the
   number the more computational resources you spread you job across and the
   faster it runs.

3. Once all of the jobs finish, run the 01_assemble_generax_bootstrap.sh script.
   This will create two new files in generax-run:

     + reconciled-tree.newick
     + reconciled-tree-with-supports.newick

   These can be used as inputs for ancestral generation in run_raxml.srun.
